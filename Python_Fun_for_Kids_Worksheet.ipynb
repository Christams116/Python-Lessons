    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we mostly work with two basic types of information: **Strings** and **Numbers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strings\n",
    "**Strings** are like words, sentences, or any text that Python needs to read. They *always* go inside quotation marks, either single (`'`) or double (`\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `\"Hello\"` is a string.\n",
    "*   `'Python is dope!!!'` is a string.\n",
    "*   `\"12\"` is also a string, even though it looks like a number, because it's inside quotes!\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do cool things with strings:\n",
    "*   **Add them together (concatenate):** `\"Hello \" + \"World\"` becomes `\"Hello World\"`\n",
    "*   **Repeat them:** `\"Repeat\" * 3` becomes `\"RepeatRepeatRepeat\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numbers\n",
    "**Numbers** are... well, numbers! They don't need quotation marks.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Integers (int):** Whole numbers like `1`, `10`, `100`.\n",
    "*   **Floats (float):** Numbers with a decimal point like `1.5`, `3.14`, `0.5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do math with numbers:\n",
    "*   `5 + 2` (addition)\n",
    "*   `10 - 3` (subtraction)\n",
    "*   `4 * 2` (multiplication)\n",
    "*   `9 / 3` (division)\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT:** You cannot mix strings and numbers directly with `+` or `*` unless you convert one of them. For example, `\"My age is \" + 10` will cause an error! But `\"My age is \" + \"10\"` works!\n"

    "*   `int()`: Changes something into a whole number (an **integer**).\n",
    "    *   `int(\"5\")` becomes the number `5`\n",
    "    *   `int(3.14)` becomes the number `3` (it chops off the decimal part!)\n",
    "*   `float()`: Changes something into a decimal number (a **float**).\n",
    "    *   `float(\"2.5\")` becomes the number `2.5`\n",
    "    *   `float(7)` becomes the number `7.0`\n",
    "*   `str()`: Changes something into a **string** (text).\n",
    "    *   `str(123)` becomes the string `\"123\"`\n",
    "    *   `str(4.5)` becomes the string `\"4.5\"`\n",

    "**When do we use this?**\n",
    "Often, when we get a number from `input()` and want to do math with it:\n",
